- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RawKitMan (Personal README, nice). I'm a full-stack web-developer/software engineer. This git-hub is my own personal playground with any personal projects
I've done in the past or currently working on, or stuff containing new tech I am learning, ie Python, Entity Framework Core, Unity (if I can get it in here). Take a look around.
